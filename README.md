**The following is a list of the 2023 Machine Learning assignments in order of each unit. Each unit covers different topics and exercises.**
>HW1
>>COVID-19 Cases Prediction
>>>Given survey results in the past 3 days in a specific state in U.S., then predict the percentage of new tested positive cases in the 3rd day\

>HW2
>>Solve a classification problem with deep neural networks (DNNs)\
>>Understand recursive neural networks (RNNs).
>>>Task: Multiclass Classification:Framewise phoneme prediction from speech\
>>>Dataset LibriSpeech (subset of train-clean-100)


>HW3
>>Solve image classification with convolutional neural networks(CNN).\
>>Learing augmentation implementation\
>>Visualize the learned visual representations of the CNN model on the
validation set by implementing t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding) on the output of both top & mid layers 
>>>Dataset Dataset\
>>>● The images are collected from the food-11 dataset splitted into 11 classes.\
>>>● Training set: 10000 labeled images\
>>>● Validation set: 3643 labeled images\
>>>● Testing set: 3000 images without labeled

>HW4
>>Task: Multiclass Classification:Predict speaker class from given speech.
>>>Dataset
>>>>○ metadata.json\
>>>>○ testdata.json\
>>>>○ mapping.json\
>>>>○ uttr-{audioID}.pt\
>>>>The information in metadata\
>>>>○ "n_mels": The dimention of mel-spectrogram.\
>>>>○ "speakers": A dictionary.\
>>>>■ Key: speaker ids\
>>>>■ Value: "feature_path" and "mel_len"


>HW5
>>Machine Translation:In this homework, we’ll translate English to Traditional Chinese
>>>Dataset
>>>>Paired data\
>>>>○ TED2020: TED talks with transcripts translated by a global community of volunteers to\
>>>>more than 100 language\
>>>>○ We will use (en, zh-tw) aligned pairs\
>>>>● Monolingual data\
>>>>○ More TED talks in traditional Chinese
